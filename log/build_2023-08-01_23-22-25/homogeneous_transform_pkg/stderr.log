[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findhomogeneous_transform_pkg.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "homogeneous_transform_pkg", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "homogeneous_transform_pkg" with any of the following names:

    homogeneous_transform_pkgConfig.cmake
    homogeneous_transform_pkg-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "homogeneous_transform_pkg" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "homogeneous_transform_pkg_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "homogeneous_transform_pkg" provides
  a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
